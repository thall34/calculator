# calculator

Creating a calculator using HTML, CSS and JS

Created basic HTML for calculator interface
Created CSS Styling to make calculator look like Apple calculator
Created functions for all basic operations that take user input and convert it to the appropriate equation
Created operate function that takes user input operator and decides the appropriate operation function to run
Created mouse events for all number and operator keys to update the display div
Created if statement for dividing by 0 to output an error message
Created if statements so that all buttons except the clear button don't do anything when the calculator is in error mode
Changed percent button to backspace button
Created if statements so that if a second operator is typed in, it will perform the operation on the first two numbers first, then add the current operator
Created values in the operation functions to round the answers to the nearest one decimal point

NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ASSIGN NUM 1 AND NUM 2 EARLIER - potentially

Work on what happens if the = button is pressed before typing in both numbers and an operator
Work on inputting multiple operators in a row not doing anything except display the last operator input
Work on when a new digit is typed in after getting a result, that it clears the old result and starts a new number

Extra credit
Add a decimal button that can add up to one decimal point on the number, disable the button if a decimal already exists
Add a backspace button to undo last input
Add keyboard support
